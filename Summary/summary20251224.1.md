# Session Summary - 2024-12-24 Session 1

## Issues Fixed

### 1. setup_codespace.sh Failure
**Problem:** Script failed at Step 5 with `error: Failed to spawn: pre-commit`

**Root Cause:** The `pre-commit` package was not included in the project dependencies. The project uses poetry format in `pyproject.toml`, but `uv sync` requires `[dependency-groups]` format.

**Solution:**
- Added `[dependency-groups]` section to `pyproject.toml` with dev dependencies
- Changed `uv sync --all-extras` to `uv sync --all-groups` in setup script
- Updated script to reference TinyTimeMixers instead of ranking_representation

### 2. Added Developer Tools
Added to `[dependency-groups]` in pyproject.toml:
- `pre-commit>=4.0.0` - Git hooks for code quality
- `ruff>=0.14.0` - Fast Python linter
- `ty>=0.0.1a1` - Fast type checker (from Astral)
- `zizmor>=1.0.0` - GitHub Actions security scanner

## Files Modified

1. **pyproject.toml**
   - Added `[dependency-groups]` section with dev tools
   - Kept poetry format for backward compatibility

2. **setup_codespace.sh**
   - Changed project name from "ranking_representation" to "TinyTimeMixers"
   - Changed `uv sync --all-extras` to `uv sync --all-groups`
   - Updated package list to show actual dev tools
   - Updated "Next steps" and "Useful commands" sections

3. **.pre-commit-config.yaml**
   - Updated all hook versions to latest
   - Fixed nbqa dependency issues

4. **tests/test_tinytimemixers.py**
   - Added missing import for TinyTimeMixers class

5. **tinytimemixers/tinytimemixers.py**
   - Fixed `mix()` to raise TypeError when no mixers present

### 3. Pre-commit Config Update
**Problem:** nbqa hooks using outdated version requiring `pkg_resources` (setuptools)

**Solution:** Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
- black: 22.3.0 → 24.10.0
- ruff-pre-commit: v0.0.255 → v0.8.4
- nbQA: 1.6.3 → 1.9.1
- Removed ipython dependency (not needed)

### 4. Test Fixes
**Problem:** Tests failing with `NameError: name 'TinyTimeMixers' is not defined`

**Solution:**
- Added missing import in `tests/test_tinytimemixers.py`
- Fixed `mix()` method to raise `TypeError` when called with no mixers

## Installed Versions
- pre-commit 4.5.1
- ruff 0.14.10
- ty 0.0.6
- zizmor 1.19.0

## TTM Implementation Planning

Created `docs/design/ADR-001-implementation.md` with full architecture decision record for implementing TinyTimeMixers from paper arXiv 2401.03955.

**Scope:**
- Full TTM implementation in PyTorch (~1M params)
- GIFT-Eval benchmark (97 tasks, 7 domains)
- TabPFN-TS comparison

**5 Phases:**
1. Core Architecture (layers, models) - COMPLETED
2. Data Pipeline (Monash, preprocessing)
3. Training Infrastructure
4. Evaluation Metrics
5. Benchmarking Harness

---

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete

### Files Created

**Configuration:**
- `tinytimemixers/config.py` - TTMConfig and TrainingConfig dataclasses

**Layers:**
- `layers/normalization.py` - RevIN (reversible instance normalization)
- `layers/mixer_mlp.py` - Time, Feature, and Channel mixing MLPs
- `layers/tsmixer_block.py` - TSMixer block and level
- `layers/patch_embedding.py` - Patch extraction and embedding
- `layers/patch_partition.py` - Adaptive patch partition/merge
- `layers/resolution_prefix.py` - Resolution prefix tuning

**Models:**
- `models/backbone.py` - TTMBackbone and TTMBackboneLight
- `models/decoder.py` - TTMDecoder
- `models/forecast_head.py` - ForecastHead variants
- `models/ttm.py` - Main TTM model with save/load

**Tests:**
- `tests/unit/test_ttm.py` - 14 unit tests (all passing)

**Notebooks:**
- `notebooks/TTM_GPU_Demo.ipynb` - Colab notebook for GPU testing

### Model Stats
- Total parameters: ~2.2M
- Input: (batch, channels, 512)
- Output: (batch, channels, 96)
- CPU-only PyTorch installed (due to codespace size limits)

### Known Issues (TODO)
1. Adaptive patching disabled (using TTMBackboneLight)
2. Resolution prefix disabled by default
3. Full CUDA dependencies not installed
